"Huffman Coding" is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. Developed by David A. Huffman in 1952, it constructs an optimal prefix code (binary tree) where frequent characters receive shorter codes, minimizing total encoded size. This greedy algorithm ensures no code is a prefix of another, enabling unambiguous decoding. Widely used in formats like ZIP and JPEG, it achieves efficient compression for text, images, and other redundant data.
